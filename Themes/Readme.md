### Introduction ###
Fundamentally, the theming system is a way to “skin” an application. However, themes can control far more than a change in the colors. It’s a way of modifying the way a screen is displayed or a series of screens flow, without changing the underlying application. 
  
Themes control the design across all platforms.  Themes come in light and dark variations for use in different environments.  Dark themes provide added visible contrast for low-light conditions. Light themes are often used in apps that are focused on productivity with easy to read text for extended work streams.


### Theme – Color Scheme ###
The color choices of the scheme have been constructed around a system that’s applied across platforms for a consistent feel and to facilitate rapid brand customization. To accomplish this, we’ve created the color scheme with the following options… 
  
 
### Base Color ### 
This is the color that will be most prominent across the design. In many cases this will follow the organizations primary brand color. However, when a brands colors fall on a neutral pallet or one of equal diversity, like we see in the Microsoft Windows colored brand image, application families can be created.  This is the path that Microsoft took with their suite of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote etc. applications.  The design and functional layout of each feels familiar while each carry their own unique sub-brand color system. 
  
With a primary base color selected, light tints and dark shades of the color act to create a visual hierarchy in the design. These complimentary colors also help in the visual balance of the design. 
  
 
### Accent Color ###
By definition, accent colors are used for emphasis in design.  Accents are used on buttons, progress bars, sliders, controls, and headlines. An accent color is meant to be bold and attract attention when and where you want the user’s attention. With neutral themes based on black and white as the primary colors of the design, supporting accent colors gain additional visual weight and attention in the design. 
  
 
### Feedback Colors ### 
A special group of accent colors are reserved for application feedback. Feedback colors are standardized to ensure that alert information is consistent across designs. Feedback colors are critical because of their integration into elements of components in the design system, like the error text of a textfield.  These elements need to stand out from other elements, so they should not use your primary color.


### Neutral Colors ###
In combination with the primary and accent colors, neutrals are added to compliment the design, adding to the visual hierarchy, along the light to dark spectrum. Neutrals are most often used in borders, lines, strokes, dividers, headlines, sub-headers, hint text and body copy, to emphasize/de-emphasize material based on the needs of the user at that point in time.
